<h1>Hancock-Client : Sinatra Middleware</h1>
<hr/>
<p>With the release of <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">sinatra</a> version 0.9.1, programmers have the option to write micro-apps that double as middleware in any other <a href="http://github.com/chneukirchen/rack/tree/master">rack</a> enabled application.  The beauty in this is that you can write rack middleware without getting bogged down in the details of writing rack directly.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s your first time leveraging rack and you want to test the waters or perhaps you&rsquo;re just wanting to slap a little bit of functionality onto someone else&rsquo;s code; sinatra is emerging as a great way for folks to start really sinking their teeth into how rack functions.</p>

<p>I recently found myself waist-deep in rack.  A lot of my co-workers at <a href="http://engineyard.com">EY</a> have been telling me for some time where rack made sense and where it didn&rsquo;t.  I didn&rsquo;t really grasp it all.  I understood it as a concept but there was nothing in my day to day work that made me say &ldquo;Hey!  I&rsquo;m gonna use rack here!&rdquo;  At least until the other day.  <a href="http://mwrc2009.confreaks.com/13-mar-2009-11-05-in-a-world-of-middleware-who-needs-monolithic-applications-jon-crosby.html">Jon Crosby rocked out with a great talk at MWRC</a> and one of <a href="http://github.com/abcde">my friends at work</a> had written a little sinatra app that we needed to merge into our Single Sign On(SSO) infrastructure.  <a href="http://github.com/halorgium">Tim</a> took advantage of an existing rack <a href="http://openid.net">openid</a> library and made the necessary modifications to hook it in cleanly, he then went on vacation and left the gem abstraction to me.  I&rsquo;m really grateful for this because it really made me sit down and acquaint myself with sinatra.  What I found was something pleasurable, elegant, and useful.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/atmos/hancock-client">hancock-client</a> gem is an abstraction of our rack based SSO middleware in use at Engine Yard but modified to communicate with the <a href="http://github.com/atmos/hancock/">hancock sso server</a>.  The gem provides a sinatra application that can be run as a standalone application or used as middleware in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">rails</a> or <a href="http://merbivore.org">merb</a>.  The application itself encompasses all of the logic required to negotiate the SSO protocol with a provider and populate session variables.  You can pretty much expect that the sinatra app provided by the hancock-client gem will integrate well with a hancock provider of the same version.</p>

<p>So when I started trying to get the middleware going I decided on three things that were necessary for it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>you need to be able to login</li>
    <li>you need to be able to logout</li>
    <li>after you login you should be greeted</li>
</ul>


<p>This makes sense for the simplest possible consumer that does something useful.  The <strong>login</strong> and <strong>logout</strong> actions are mapped to <strong>/sso/login</strong> and <strong>/sso/logout</strong> respectively.  Does the &ldquo;after you login you should be greeted&rdquo; step really make sense for middleware though?  I feel like the answer is no in this situation and it&rsquo;s where the beauty of rack really comes to light.  Since my code shares the same rack session that my framework code will share, maybe I should leave that greeting page up to the app that&rsquo;s using the middleware.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090323-b69yget8ijmcs35ys8eqmsd1y4.jpg" alt="Middleware" /></p>

<p>The SSO middleware handles the authentication earlier in the stack than your framework and all you need to do is rely on a set of conventions that the middleware provides to the framework layer.  In the case of hancock-client it sets the <strong>:user_id</strong> session variable.  Depending on your middleware ordering this happens way before your framework is hit.  The basic approach for the initial release of hancock-client went something like this, &ldquo;only implement login and logout but provide examples of how you might use it in your framework of choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What we created was a class that inherited from <strong>Sinatra::Default</strong> called <strong>Hancock::Client::Default</strong>.  This class was created with the idea that an application developer would inherit from it and implement the greeting page at &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo;.  So in its simplest form you can implement a hancock-client app in the following fashion:</p>

<script src="http://gist.github.com/83061.js"></script>


<p>Notice how the middleware can be extended to support requests to <strong>/</strong> in sinatra with ease and you can simply let those requests pass through in frameworks that implement them at a higher level.</p>

<p>Notice the usage of the configuration option <strong>sso_url</strong>.  You need to set this to the url of your SSO server.  If you ever need to reference this in the markup it&rsquo;s available as <strong>options.sso_url</strong>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re using this as middleware in other frameworks you&rsquo;ll have to make sure that you set <strong>disable :raise_errors</strong> on your <strong>Hancock::Client::Default</strong> subclass.  Otherwise you&rsquo;ll get 404s and that&rsquo;s kind of annoying.  Checkout <a href="http://blog.ra66i.org/">raggi</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://gist.github.com/81199">gist</a> too.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the standalone sinatra apps are hella useful.  I love when we want to try out some new 3rd party application that offers remote authentication and we can hook the two apps up with a simple sinatra app in no time.  Seriously, <strong>do not disregard sinatra</strong> as a possible solution because you think you might need big feature X in framework Y.  Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t extend that monolith app that&rsquo;s getting more complex by the day.  Maybe some micro-apps will be just what the doctor ordered. I might be crazy or living some sheltered developer lifestyle, but it is a pleasure to write sinatra code.</p>

<p>If you investigate the tests in hancock-client you&rsquo;ll find that there aren&rsquo;t many unit tests.  I think there&rsquo;s 2 and one is currently pending.  If you checkout the cucumber tests though you&rsquo;ll find <a href="http://safariwatir.rubyforge.org/">safariwatir</a> tests that drive your browser and test against the <a href="http://hancock.atmos.org">hancock sso sandbox</a>.  All you need to do is investigate the <strong><a href="http://github.com/atmos/hancock-client/blob/master/examples/dragon/config.ru">examples/dragon</a></strong> directory in hancock-client and run the following command.</p>

<p><code>% rackup -p 4567 config.ru</code></p>

<p>In another terminal you should be able to run the following:</p>

<p><code>% rake features</code></p>

<p>A browser should appear, you should see that you successfully signed up for an SSO account, and that your consumer application has access to a few session variables.  I chose safariwatir in this case because it allowed me to blackbox test the appserver and I chose cucumber because I was pretty sure I could copy this functionality over to merb and rails as I created examples for those frameworks.  If you&rsquo;re on a mac, please try to run these specs and let me know if they work for you.</p>

<p>One thing that I&rsquo;m really hoping to handle in the next release is the ability to make the SSO before filters in rails/merb a thing of the past.  I actually need to get the merb example working&hellip;  If any of this interests you, you&rsquo;re welcome to fork my projects on github or hook me up with patches.</p>
