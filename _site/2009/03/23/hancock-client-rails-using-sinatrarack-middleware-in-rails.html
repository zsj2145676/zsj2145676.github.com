<h1>Hancock-Client-Rails: Works with Rails > 2.3.x</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been writing a bunch about <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">sinatra</a> as middleware and one of the things you always hear people glorifying is how rack middleware can be dropped into any framework that&rsquo;s built on rack.  Since I&rsquo;m trying to get people to try <a href="http://github.com/atmos/hancock">hancock</a> out, or atleast learn something from it, I figured I should investigate how you actually use the <a href="http://github.com/atmos/hancock-client">hancock-client</a> sinatra app inside off rails 2.3.2.</p>

<p>One of the examples I&rsquo;ve seen in quite a few presentations on using middleware in rack has something along the lines of:</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090323-m4hba3yiqxdsupf389t8fxt4i3.jpg" alt="middleware" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve yet to get a sample like this working with sinatra middleware.  For some reason sinatra always throws 404 errors instead of allowing those requests to pass through to rails.  Even if I set &ldquo;disable :raise_errors&rdquo; in my sinatra app, it&rsquo;d still throw 404s.  So after a little googling I discovered a wonderful write up over at the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html">rails on rack</a> page.  I definitely learned a lot about how rails middleware works but I still couldn&rsquo;t get my sinatra app functioning properly inside of rails.</p>

<p>I was kind of surprised to find out that there was very little documentation on using sinatra as middleware.  Sinatra is awesome for this, how could I be the first person trying to do this?  It turns out that I wasn&rsquo;t. :)  <a href="http://blog.ra66i.org/">Raggi</a> had explained how to do this to someone in #rack on freenode a few days earlier.  I looked through his <a href="http://gist.github.com/81199">gist on how he did it</a>.  I didn&rsquo;t understand it all but I hadn&rsquo;t tried using the metal generator that rails introduced recently.  So I gave that a try and ended up with a piece of rails metal that looks like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090323-bw211t8spchuk6hu6tmxp7qu94.jpg" alt="hancock metal" /></p>

<p>This actually worked perfectly for me.  All I needed to do was make a subclass of Hancock::Client::Default and set the appropriate configuration options.  Next I gave myself a little helper in application.rb to check whether I was logged in or not, you&rsquo;ve probably done something like this in every other app you&rsquo;ve ever used.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090323-d1qrceyie3xme7ktf54sqccd28.jpg" alt="logged_in helper" /></p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s a simple controller that should be protected by the SSO middleware.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090323-nhhtb1wb9j6b6xb38b25347b6b.jpg" alt="protected controller action" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it, hopefully this will save you some time.  One thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed in trying to make this work with the larger frameworks is that I really want some sort of implicit before filter.  I&rsquo;d really like to have the redirect to &lsquo;/sso/login&rsquo; happen anytime an unauthenticated request comes in,  I&rsquo;ll try to get that working in the next release.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created an <a href="http://github.com/atmos/hancock-client-rails">example application</a> that I&rsquo;m hoping to keep up to date as hancock grows.  There are git tags that match up to a hancock release number as well.  If you want to see a rails client in action you can run &ldquo;rake features&rdquo; inside of the hancock-client-rails application.  You&rsquo;ll need to be on a mac due to the <a href="http://github.com/redsquirrel/safariwatir/tree/master">safariwatir</a> constraint but it should drive your browser and complete a full handshake against the <a href="http://hancock.atmos.org">hancock sso sandbox</a>.</p>
